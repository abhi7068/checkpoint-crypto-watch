name: Routing

### Objective:
- Routing is the process of redirecting a user to different page based on their action or request. We will be using React Router in our application to navigate a user to a different page.

- Four pages make up our application. If a user visites our application, the user will be prompted with the login page and if the user is not register then he will be asked to register first.

-After successful registration the user will be routed to the login page, and will be asked to enter the same credentials with which he registered.

-Finally the User will be redirected to the main page of our site after successful login.




### Note:
- We should be editing the App Component throughout the checkpoint. So, make sure you are following the instructions properly.
- The efficient usage of localStorage is essential to Perfect Routing.
- Make sure the user cannot access the primary routes even if they alter the URL.
