## Objective

- This checkpoint's major goal is to familiarise you with REST API requests, routing, authentication, and working with forms and tables.
- You will only be required to complete the aforementioned activities during this checkpoint.
- To make API calls, you may use either the built-in fetch function of javascript or any other library.
- REACT-ROUTER-DOM should be used for routing.
- Rest is up to you in terms of implementation.


## Notes
- Do your research thoroughly before beginning your work; this will offer you a general notion of how the application will seem.
- We anticipate that you will pay more attention to the functionality than the style as it has already been done for you.
- The api.js file located in the config folder contains all the helpful APIs that you will require to complete the checkpoint.
