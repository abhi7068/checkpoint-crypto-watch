## Crypto Watch
### Milestone Objective:
Building the crypto Watch will require concepts below concepts:-
- REST API calls
- Routing
- Authentication
- Tables and forms




We are going to incrementally build the project by completing it stepwise!

This checkpoint comprises of four steps to build a Crypto watch app.

Reference template code to get started is [here](https://github.com/abhi7068/checkpoint-crypto-watch-template)

Here is the overview about the four steps:
1. Performing Routing in the app.js file.
2. Authentication in the Login/register page
3. Rest API calls in the required pages
4. Displaying Data on the site

## Notes

- We anticipate that you will pay more attention to the functionality than the style as it has already been done for you.
- The api.js file located in the config folder contains all the helpful APIs that you will require to complete the checkpoint.
