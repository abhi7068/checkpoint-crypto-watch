### Objective:
- Application programming interface, or API for short, is a collection of definitions and protocols for creating and integrating application software. Like Twitter offers Twitter APIs for embedding tweets on our site, YouTube API enables developers to incorporate YouTube videos.
- To retrieve coin data for our checkpoint, we will use the [coingecko.com](https://coingecko.com) APIs.
- In the Home Page we will be having a Coin table that will contain all the coins and their data respective.

- Use CoinTable API in the api.js file in the config folder to the fetch the data and get the response, finally the response should then be assigned to the state.

- Now finally we are done with our Coin Table, but what if the user wants to know more about a particular coin, so for that we will fetch data for that Single Coin as well, but before that we will make sure that when a user clicks on a coin the Id of the coin is passed properly in to the url. In our case the ID is the name of the coin itself.

  ``https://cryptoowatch.vercel.app/coins/bitcoin``
  
- In the coin page we have to fetch data for the single coin using the id from the URL and display the data on the page.

- To fetch the image of the movie, you need to use the `backdrop_path` which is returned by the above API and make a call to the following URL:
    
- The Banner component should be imported inside the `App` component and should be rendered inside the `App` component after `Navbar` component.

### Note:
- You should be making changes in the Banner.js file, which is present inside the `components` folder.
- All the CSS styles are already present inside the `Banner.css` file, which is present inside the `components` folder. so make use of it!

### Expected output:

## API Calls

- Our checkpoint's final and most crucial part is teaching you how to use API calls.
- There are 4 instances in the application where you will use API calls; the API endpoints are listed in the config folder'sÂ api.js file.
- Use the CoinList endpoint to get the list of coins to display on your website.
- The SingleCoin API endpoint should get the details of a particular coin when a user clicks on it and display them on the singleCoin page.
- The Chart that is displayed on the Single Coin page is accessible via the third API endpoint in the api.js file.
- The Trending CoinList endpoint appears at the conclusion. You'll utilise this Endpoint to get the popular Coins.
