## API Calls

- Our checkpoint's final and most crucial part is teaching you how to use API calls.
- There are 4 instances in the application where you will use API calls; the API endpoints are listed in the config folder'sÂ api.js file.
- Use the CoinList endpoint to get the list of coins to display on your website.
- The SingleCoin API endpoint should get the details of a particular coin when a user clicks on it and display them on the singleCoin page.
- The Chart that is displayed on the Single Coin page is accessible via the third API endpoint in the api.js file.
- The Trending CoinList endpoint appears at the conclusion. You'll utilise this Endpoint to get the popular Coins.
