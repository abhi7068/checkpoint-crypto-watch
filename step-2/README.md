### Objective:
- Authentication's main objective is to positively identify each user of our application, to identify each user and protect our programme from unidentifiable users, we will integrate authentication using the localStorage.

- Starting with registration, a form is already built for you, your task is to give fuctionality to it. Create a state and store the user data into it in the form of json.
